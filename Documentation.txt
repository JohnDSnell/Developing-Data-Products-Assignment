This Shiny app was written to enable a user to explore the correlation between sleep deprivation and reaction time in an interactive way.<br>Inputs are kept simple -  one control allows a user to identify a specific participant they wish to explore. <br>The default for this selection is all 18 participants. <br><br>Selection of a specific participant isolates their data.<br>The system plots that data, offset against the fastest time within the data subset, together with the regression line for that data.<br><br>When <i>all</i> participants are selected, the regression line is for all the data points for all participants. A table of the regression coefficients for each of the selected participants is displayed below the plot. In the case of <i>all</i> being selected, the first row in the table shows the values associated with the displayed regression line. The other row entries show the specific regression characteristics for each individual participant. <br><br>Participant <b>335</b> is worthy of detailed examination.<br>
